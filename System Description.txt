# Sensors: 
I used 3 IR sensors, each one will be placed on a specific hight based on the boxes sizes
For example:
first sensor will be placed on 10 CM to trace  the 10*10*10 boxes

# Controller : Arduino 

# Motors:
I used 3 Servo motors each one is coneccted with on of the sensors and each motor will move in different angle
